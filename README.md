Generic Routines for Dynamic Macroeconomic Models
*************************************************

This repository contains a variety of routines that are useful for dynamic macroeconomic models. 

## Contents
routines: contains miscellaneous routines for interpolation, solvers, etc. 
firm: production functions and marginal products. TO DO: add dynamic routines that solve Hopenhayn-Rogerson/Khan-Thomas style blocks 
household: EGM solvers for 1-asset income fluctuation problems. TO DO: add 2-asset solvers. 
distribution: utilities to iterate a distribution given a policy function. Works for 2D and 3D problems (one exog, one/two endog states)

## Extensions
add generic General Equilibrium solvers
